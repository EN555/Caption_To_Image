# Description
The dataset consists of a collection of images along with their corresponding captions. The goal is to build a model that can automatically generate accurate and meaningful captions for previously unseen images.

The provided code includes pre-processing steps for image and text data, as well as various models and techniques for caption generation. The repository also contains evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the generated captions, such as BLEU score and METEOR score.

The Image-to-Caption task offers an exciting opportunity to explore the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques, we aim to develop models that can understand the content of an image and express it in human-readable text.
